                        In this report, we provide a comprehensive overview of the unrest and conflict
                        events that occurred in the Eurasian region between 2017 and 2025. This analysis
                        leverages data provided by <a href="https://acleddata.com/" target="_blank">ACLED</a>
                        (Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project), an independent organization dedicated to
                        monitoring and collecting data on conflicts and protests worldwide. <br>

                        Typically, when consuming news about global conflicts, it is
                        difficult to fully grasp their true magnitude, as such comprehension
                        requires a significant effort of imagination. For this reason, we have produced
                        an in-depth analysis of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, examining the nature of the hostilities,
                        the evolution of modern warfare modalities, and the broader economic and geopolitical impacts on
                        Europe and the global community.

                    Data regarding the 2017–2025 period highlights a significant shift in the
                    geographical focus of instability. In the initial phase (2017–2019), the Eurasian
                    landscape was defined primarily by the localized conflict in Eastern Ukraine (Donbas)
                    and political unrest within Russia. However, starting from 2020, the trend of
                    civil disorder moved decisively towards Western Europe. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        France emerges as the country with the highest frequency of civil unrest,
                        recording approximately 40,000 events. A detailed breakdown of the event types reveals a
                        distinct geographical dichotomy:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Protests</strong>: Peaceful demonstrations are widespread across the entire
                            territory, with particularly
                            high intensity observed along the Western coast (Brittany/Nouvelle-Aquitaine) and in the
                            Southern regions.</li><br>

                        <li><strong>Riots</strong>: Conversely, violent riots are far more localized, showing a sharp
                            concentration in the
                            Île-de-France (Paris) region and major urban hubs like Lyon, while remaining less frequent
                            in rural areas.</li><br>
                    </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Italy ranks second with over 26,000 recorded events. As visualized in the heatmap, these
                        manifestations
                        are clustered around major urban centers and the northern regions.
                        Notably, the data indicates a marginally higher incidence of excessive force used
                        against protesters in Italy (14 recorded instances) compared to its neighbors.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Germany and Spain follow in the rankings. Germany shows a widespread
                        distribution of roughly 24,000 events, while Spain (approx. 22,000 events)
                        displays a distinct pattern where unrest is concentrated in the capital, Madrid, and along the
                        coastal regions.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Returning to the analysis of the Eurasian region, we can observe that Battles and
                        Explosions have established themselves as the predominant forms of disorder.
                        This trend offers a compelling explanation for the extremely low levels of civil unrest
                        recorded in the same period: the high security risks inherent in a conflict zone make it
                        virtually
                        impossible for the population to organize or attend public protests.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Specifically, Ukraine has emerged as the absolute epicenter of this violence.
                        The data reveals a staggering escalation in the number of battle events:
                        In 2017, during the localized conflict in the east, only 37 events were recorded and
                        by 2022, with the onset of the full-scale invasion, this number surged to 7,569.</li><br>
                        By 2025, the intensity of the conflict further intensified, reaching a peak of 22,353
                        recorded events, nearly tripling the figures seen at the start of the invasion.</li><br>

                        As is widely known, the conflict on Ukrainian soil has been ongoing for nearly a decade,
                        with violence historically concentrated along the eastern border in the Donetsk and Luhansk
                        regions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, starting from February 24 2022, the distribution of events changed drastically.
                        Explosions were no longer confined to the south-east but spread simultaneously across all
                        borders
                        shared with Russia and Belarus, as well as along the Black Sea coast.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A distinction in combat modalities is visible: ground battles are concentrated primarily
                        along the land borders, whereas coastal areas have been subjected mainly to explosions and
                        shelling.
                        This reflects the strategic difficulty of launching large-scale amphibious infantry invasions,
                        leading forces to rely on remote strikes against port cities.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The map highlights key turning points in the conflict timeline:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li></strong>April 1 2022</strong>: The withdrawal of Russian troops from the Kyiv region
                            (North).</li>
                        <li></strong>September 5 2022</strong>: The Ukrainian counter-offensive in the Kharkiv region.
                        </li>
                        <li></strong>November 11 2022</strong>: The liberation of Kherson.</li>
                        <li></strong>May 20 2023</strong>: The capture of Bakhmut.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Regarding Russian territory, initially, events were sparse and strictly limited
                        to the immediate border areas. Over time (specifically about a year into the
                        conflict) attacks began to reach deeper into the country, striking regions such as Ryazan,
                        Rostov, and Kursk. While the intensity of these deep strikes has increased with the
                        proliferation of drone warfare, the absolute number of events on Russian soil remains
                        significantly lower compared to the devastation observed within Ukraine.

                    <p>
                        Consistent with the previous graph, the highest number of fatalities within
                        Ukrainian territory is concentrated in regions that experienced the most intense conflict,
                        such as Donetska and Khersonska. However, a comparison between battle-related and
                        explosion-related events reveals distinct patterns. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While western regions show minimal activity in both categories,
                        the relationship between explosions and total fatalities is not always
                        proportional in the east. For instance, Sumska highlights this discrepancy: <br>
                        while the data shows a significant impact from explosions, the overall victim
                        count remains lower compared to the primary frontlines.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conversely, regions such as Kharkivska, Zaporizka, and especially Luhanska record high
                        fatality numbers driven largely by battles, even in areas where the intensity of explosions
                        may not appear as the sole dominant factor compared to heavily shelled zones like Donbas.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Analyzing the conflict from a district-level perspective, we observe that explosions are
                        significantly more widely distributed than battles, which remain heavily concentrated in
                        districts along the borders and frontlines.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Khersonskyi district emerges as the primary focal point of attacks, followed by Pokrovskyi.
                        In contrast, explosions are recorded across nearly the entire Ukrainian territory, although
                        their
                        intensity remains highest in the regions closest to the border.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The municipal perspective allows for a granular assessment of how individual cities within
                        key regions have been impacted by the conflict. Notably, the data highlights Kherson as the
                        municipality recording the highest intensity of battles.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the view on explosions reveals a fundamentally different pattern. While battles
                        are largely confined to municipalities near the border and frontlines, explosions are far more
                        widespread.
                        The data indicates that geographic distance from the border is not sufficient to ensure safety,
                        as nearly
                        every region across Ukraine contains at least one municipality that has been hit by explosions.

                        The visualization illustrates how the conflict has
                        fundamentally altered the nature of events within the country and how Explosions and
                        Remote Violence (orange bar) have drastically changed the distribution passing form 56% to 78%,
                        becoming the majority of total events since the onset of the war together the battles.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conversely, civil unrest events (such as protests, riots,
                        and violence against civilians) have nearly vanished.

                    <p>
                        This is a typical consequence of full-scale conflict: public safety concerns
                        prevent civilians from gathering in the streets, while the imposition of martial
                        law redirects state resources and authority entirely toward national defense,
                        effectively suppressing ordinary civil demonstrations.

                        The chart highlights a clear transformation in the conflict's dynamics,
                        both in tactical terms and, by inference, in economic terms. In the initial phase,
                        shelling and missile attacks (Red line) were the predominant method of engagement. <br>
                        However, following an upward trend in the first two years,
                        this type of attack exhibited a steady decline, reaching its lowest levels between
                        late 2024 and 2025.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Conversely, both Air/Drone Strikes (Orange line) and Armed Clashes (Blue line)
                        have maintained a slow but steady upward trend since the beginning of hostilities.
                        Around mid-2024, a turning point is observed: the frequency of these two event types
                        surpassed that of artillery shelling.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This trend reversal suggests several important strategic implications:

                    <p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Tactical Evolution:</strong> The conflict appears to have shifted from a phase
                                dominated by long-range strikes to one characterized by short-range incursions
                                (ground clashes) and the massive use of drones. </li>
                            <li><strong>Economic and Technological Impact:</strong> The decrease in missile usage (which is
                                costly and resource-intensive) in favor of drones and infantry may indicate
                                an adaptation towards a more sustainable war economy, potentially suggesting
                                a depletion of missile stockpiles or a strategic shift based on cost-effectiveness.</li>

                        Russia appears to have consolidated its economy around energy extraction,
                        signaling a shift towards a less diversified model increasingly dependent on fossil fuels.
                        Crude/Refined Petroleum retained the top position, increasing from 40.1% to 44.1%, while Natural
                        Gas rose to become the second-largest export (growing from 8.4% to 9.9%),
                        and Coal saw a significant jump (from 3.8% to 6.9%).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In contrast, Ukraine has experienced a forced structural shift. The heavy industry sector
                        collapsed,
                        with Metals (formerly the leading export at 23.4%) dropping drastically to 9.7%.
                        This decline likely reflects the severe loss of industrial capacity in the eastern
                        regions (Donbas) affected by the war. Conversely, the agricultural sector has proven
                        to be the most resilient pillar of the economy, as the export share of essential
                        goods like Cereals and Seed Oils significantly increased.

                    <p>
                        The total export volume contracted significantly over the two-year period,
                        dropping from $490 billion in 2021 to $390 billion in 2023.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the pre-war period, Russian trade partnerships were diversified globally,
                        with Europe representing approximately half of the total market. At that time,
                        the Netherlands served as the leading importer, followed by the United Kingdom, Italy, and
                        Belarus.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the conflict radically altered this balance. Europe's share plummeted to less than
                        20% of the total proportion. The market void left by European sanctions was aggressively filled
                        by
                        Asia, which surged from approximately 30% to roughly 75% of the market share, establishing
                        itself as
                        Russia's primary trading partner.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In this new landscape, the main export destinations have shifted to China, India, Turkey,
                        and Kazakhstan. The conflict also had severe repercussions on overseas trade, particularly
                        with North America, which drastically decreased its imports from Russia, effectively severing
                        trade relations.
                        "Analyzing Ukraine, the total export volume contracted sharply, falling from $69 billion in 2021
                        to $40 billion in 2023.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the pre-conflict period, Ukraine's trade partnerships were geographically balanced,
                        similar to the pre-war Russian distribution. Major importers included Poland, China, and
                        notably Russia itself, followed by Italy and Germany.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the post-conflict landscape reveals a radical geopolitical shift. In stark contrast
                        to Russia (which pivoted to Asia), Ukraine has fully reoriented towards the West. Europe has
                        become the predominant importer, now absorbing approximately 75% of Ukrainian exports. Trade
                        with Russia has ceased entirely. The new leading partners are Poland, followed by Romania
                        (which saw a significant rise), Germany, Spain, and Italy.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Asian market has shrunk in relative importance but remains relevant, driven primarily by
                        exports to Turkey and China. Finally, regarding Africa, Egypt stands out as a critical partner,
                        absorbing the vast majority of Ukrainian exports directed to the African continent. <br>

                    <p>
                        The Russian market's relationship with European countries has undergone a drastic
                        transformation.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the pre-war period (2021), the trade landscape was dominated by the exchange of
                        Crude and Refined Petroleum, followed by Natural Gas and Metals. These exports were widely
                        distributed across EU member states, generating a massive total trade volume of €132.5 billion.
                        <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the 2023 war-time scenario, however, the situation changed radically. The primary
                        export mix shifted, with Natural Gas taking a more prominent share relative to oil, which
                        saw a significant reduction. Most notably, the overall volume of trade collapsed, plummeting to
                        just €41.9 billion.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Turning our attention to Ukraine, we observe a moderate decrease in total trade volume, which
                        fell
                        from €19.2 billion in 2021 to €17.1 billion in 2023. Notably, Ukraine's 2023 trade volume
                        represents less
                        than half of Russia's volume (€41.9 billion) for the same period.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While the core trading partners have remained largely the same, their ranking has shifted
                        significantly.
                        This is largely due to the reduced availability of strategic raw materials, particularly Metals,
                        which saw
                        a sharp decline in exports. This shortage directly impacted Italy's position: formerly the
                        leading trade
                        partner in 2021 (largely driven by metal imports), Italy has fallen towards the bottom of the
                        ranking in 2023.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Consequently, the conflict forced Ukraine to restructure its export economy. The country
                        transitioned from
                        a model heavily reliant on metals and minerals to an economy focused on agricultural
                        commodities, specifically
                        Cereals and Oil Seeds, which have become the dominant export categories in the war-time
                        scenario. <br>

                        The chart illustrates how the outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine conflict resulted
                        in a substantial increase in the prices of food commodities monitored by the FAO,
                        thereby contributing to widespread inflation within the sector
                        (as reported by
                        <a href="https://it.tradingeconomics.com/euro-area/inflation-cpi" ,
                            target="_blank">tradingeconomics</a> for the Euro Area).

                    <p>
                        Specifically, cereals (indicated by the purple line) experienced significant price hikes.
                        An analysis of FAO export data reveals that, just 12 months into the conflict,
                        Ukraine’s market share was drastically reduced:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Wheat:</strong> Ukraine fell from 5th to 7th place among global exporters
                            (decreasing from approximately 19.4 to 11.2 million tonnes, a drop of 42%).</li>
                        <li><strong>Barley:</strong> It dropped from 3rd to 5th place (a decrease of 60%).</li>
                        <li><strong>Maize:</strong> While slipping from 3rd to 4th place, it actually recorded
                            a slight increase in volume (+3%).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This contraction in supply drove prices to peaks equal to or exceeding
                        those reached during the severe financial crisis of 2008.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the commodity that experienced the sharpest price increase
                        was vegetable oil (red line). Although Ukraine maintained its position
                        as the leading exporter of sunflower oil, export volumes declined by 16%
                        (from 5.1 to 4.3 million tonnes), causing the price index to surge by more
                        than 50 points compared to the previous year.

                        It is evident that, starting from the second half of 2022,
                        gas prices experienced a sharp surge—peaking at nearly double the pre-war
                        values—before entering a slow decline in subsequent years, but despite this downward trend,
                        prices in 2025 remain significantly higher than in the pre-conflict period.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This trend can be largely attributed to the termination of gas supply
                        contracts with Russia and the resulting energy crisis.
                        This shift reflects the broader geopolitical strategy adopted by Europe,
                        including sanctions and diversification measures intended to disincentivize the continuation of
                        the conflict.

                    <p>
                        Two major phenomena emerge from the data:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>The isolation of Ukraine:</strong> By late 2022, Ukraine registered 0 flights,
                            dropping from over 2,100 monthly flights in 2021. This total collapse is a
                            direct consequence of the closure of Ukrainian airspace due to extreme security risks
                            (no-fly zone), effectively severing the country's aerial connectivity. </li>

                        <li><strong>The shifting of logistic hubs:</strong> While Russia maintained its position as the
                            top
                            destination with stable flight volumes (increasing slightly from ~18,900 to ~19,700),
                            a dramatic shift occurred in neighboring countries. Poland experienced a massive surge,
                            with flights nearly quadrupling from 3,943 to 14,143. This suggests that Poland has absorbed
                            the traffic intended for Ukraine, becoming the primary logistical gateway for the region.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Focusing on Russia as a flight destination, we extracted data covering February to November
                        2021 and compared this pre-conflict baseline with the equivalent timeframe in 2022.

                    <p>
                        Examining the percentage differences, we immediately observe that European countries
                        have effectively severed ties with Russia, with flight traffic dropping by nearly 100% across
                        the board. <br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        However, the market void left by Europe has been rapidly filled by other players.
                        As shown in the data, the United Arab Emirates and Belarus have significantly increased their
                        presence.
                        Meanwhile, countries like Kazakhstan, Israel, and Turkey have reduced their absolute volume of
                        flights but
                        have not terminated relationships entirely.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of absolute numbers, Germany shows the steepest decline, recording 1,109 fewer flights
                        compared to the previous year, followed by Italy with a reduction of 452 flights. The 'Other'
                        category
                        confirms this is a generalized global trend of disengagement.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The shift in market share is the most telling indicator of this geopolitical realignment.
                        While Germany's share collapsed from 13.4% to 0.1% and Italy's from 5.5% to 0.1%, other nations
                        absorbed this traffic:<br>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Turkey</strong> Market share surged from 10.7% to 28.5%. </li><br>
                        <li><strong>Belarus</strong>: Increased from 5.0% to 27.0%.</li><br>
                        <li><strong>United Arab Emirates</strong>: Jumped from 6.2% to 28.2%.</li>
                    </ul>
                    These figures vividly demonstrate how quickly geopolitical dynamics can reshape economic
                    connectivity within a span of just 12 months.
