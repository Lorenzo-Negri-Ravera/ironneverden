                            <br>
                            First, for a more general analysis, the focus is on the geographical distribution of 
                            civil unrest in Europe and Central Asia.
                            <br>                        
                            The following heatmap highlights the 15 countries with the highest number of 
                            total events recorded during the period analyzed (2017-2025).
                            In that period, is possible to observe that Russia and Ukraine have a particularly
                            high concentration of activities, with an increase starting in 2022.

                        <p>
                            To analyze the internal and external tensions, we examine the cumulative frequencies of events 
                            (Battles, Explosions/Remote violence, Protests, Riots and Violence against civilians) recorded in 
                            Russia and Ukraine since 2017.

                    <p>
                        As shown by the data, is evident that Ukraine has experienced a significantly higher number of battles and explosions/remote violence compared to Russia.
                        This highlights the asymmetrical nature of the ukranian-russian conflict, with first experiencing more civilian-targeted violence 
                        in the form of bomings and battles on its soil.
                        Meanwhile, Russia has seen a higher incidence of protests and riots, indicating internal dissent possibly related to the war effort and its consequences.

                        Moreover, an analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of protests types in Russia and Ukraine. 
                        The following waffle chart illustrates the incidence of the three categories: 
                        "Peaceful protest", "Protest with intervention" and "Excessive force against protesters".

                        The chart allows us to visually compare the incidence of peaceful protests with those that required
                        intervention by the police (moderate or with excessive force), highlighting the different dynamics
                        of public order management in the two countries. 
                        <br>
                        Specifically, protests involving a state response are recorded at a significantly higher rate in Russia.
                        In total, 19% of protests in Russia faced interventionin, in sharp contrast to Ukraine, where state responses 
                        occurred in 4% of protests. Excessive force is used in 1% of protests in Ukraine, whereas its value in Russia is less 
                        than 1%.
                        <br>
                        However, the peaceful protests are the predominant category in both nations, comprising 81% of the total protests in Russia 
                        and 96% in Ukraine.

                    <p>
                        After comparing the two countries, the final phase of the analysis focuses exclusively on the internal 
                        evolution of events in Ukraine.
                        The barchart illustrates the temporal trend of the total number of events that occurred in the country,
                        which shows a substantial increase starting in 2022, almost tripling the total number of events from the 
                        previous year and consequently highlighting the occurrence of a crucial phenomenon.

                        Subsequently, we seek to understand in greater depth and detail the increase in events that have occurred in 
                        the country over the years.
                        The visualization reveals a dramatic shift. Prior to 2022, "Protests" accounted for the majority of events. 
                        Since that year, however, their incidence has droped, coinciding with a significant increase in battles, 
                        explosions, and remote violence that now overshadows previous protests.
                        The 2022 peak in the "Violence against civilians" category is also significant, highlighting the armed conflict's 
                        heavy impact on the civilian population.

                        Taken all these insights together, they mark the beginning of the large-scale armed conflict. 
                        The data illustrates a clear transition point in 2022, moving from a state of political instability, primarily defined by protests, 
                        to an armed conflict, dominated by battles and remote violence.

                    <h4>Analysis of Population Exposure During the Conflict in Ukraine</h4>
                    <p>
                        Since Battles and Explosions are the majority of events in the years of the conflict, an analysis was conducted 
                        to understand the level of population exposed to these two main events.

                        The provided boxplot offers a direct comparison of this aspect, allowing to observe how remote explosions put civilians at
                        greater risk and highlighting the cruel aspect of modern warfare, which is mostly composed of remote explosions rather than 
                        field battles. It is observable how the maximum exposed population reached by a remote explosion event is double that reached 
                        by a battle-type event and how typically explosions involve a larger number of civilians than what is observed for battles.

                        Given the relevance of remote explosions, the analysis will subsequently focus on the impact of different specific types of 
                        remote explosions and on the deaths caused by this type of event. 
                        In particular, the Violin Plot attempts to analyze the distribution of the 3 most frequent attacks of this type: air/drone strike,
                        artillery/missile attack, and landmine.

                    <p>
                        For the y-axis, a Log Scale was used to obtain a better visualization, since the data cover a wide range of values. 
                        From the plot it is possible to observe how Air/drone strikes and artillery/missiles tend to involve a large number of people,
                        also having a higher number of events. 
                        This is easily readable by looking at the shapes of the different violin plots; they are very similar in terms of Air/drone strike 
                        and Artillery/Missile attack, while quite different for landmines.
                        Furthermore, it is observable how Air/Drone strikes and Artillery/Missile attacks are the two main attacks directed at bigger 
                        cities that involve a large population, up to 1 million.

                        "Remote Explosions" events alone. 
                        However, it is important to observe from the histogram how many attacks of this type, fortunately, cause zero or 
                        very few deaths (less than 20). Nevertheless, unfortunately, we must consider the tail of the graph, which represents 
                        less frequent but catastrophic events (more than 100 fatalities).

                        As shown in the follow graph, it is possible to observe the evolution of the use of the three main types 
                        of attacks on Ukrainian territory before and during the war. All attack types show a sharp increase in 2022,
                        corresponding to the beginning of the conflict.

                    <p>
                        Specifically, Shelling/artillery/missile attacks were the predominant tactic, reaching peaks of almost 1.000 events per week. 
                        However, their frequency showed a gradual and steady decline over time.
                        At the same time, air/drone attacks increased steadily, culminating in 2024 in the strategic overtaking of artillery, 
                        thus becoming the main offensive method used. Attacks using remote explosives/mines/IEDs constitute the third tactic; 
                        although they remain at significantly lower levels than the other two, their impact remains significant in the context of a protracted conflict.
