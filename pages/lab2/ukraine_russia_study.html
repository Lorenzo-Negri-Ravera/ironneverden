                            <br>
                            First, for a more general analysis, the focus is on the geographical distribution of 
                            civil unrest in Europe and Central Asia.
                            <br>                        
                            The following heatmap highlights the 15 countries with the highest number of 
                            total events recorded during the period analyzed (2017-2025).
                            In that period, is possible to observe that Russia and Ukraine have a particularly
                            high concentration of activities, with an increase starting in 2022.

                        This highlights the significant effects on the civilian population of the raging conflict between Ukraine and Russia.
                        To understand better the phenomena, a deeper analysis is performed on the two countries.

                    <h4>Comparison of events between Ukraine and Russia</h4>
                        <p>
                            To analyze the internal and external tensions, we examine the cumulative frequencies of events 
                            (Battles, Explosions/Remote violence, Protests, Riots and Violence against civilians) recorded in 
                            Russia and Ukraine since 2017.

                <div class="text-container mt-5">
                    <p>
                        As shown by the data, is evident that Ukraine has experienced a significantly higher number of battles and explosions/remote violence compared to Russia.
                        This highlights the asymmetrical nature of the ukranian-russian conflict, with first experiencing more civilian-targeted violence 
                        in the form of bomings and battles on its soil.
                        Meanwhile, Russia has seen a higher incidence of protests and riots, indicating internal dissent possibly related to the war effort and its consequences.

                        Moreover, an analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of protests types in Russia and Ukraine. 
                        The following waffle chart illustrates the incidence of the three categories: 
                        "Peaceful protest", "Protest with intervention" and "Excessive force against protesters".

                    <p>
                        The chart allows us to visually compare the incidence of peaceful protests with those that required
                        intervention by the police (moderate or with excessive force), highlighting the different dynamics
                        of public order management in the two countries. 
                        <br>
                        Specifically, protests involving a state response are recorded at a significantly higher rate in Russia.
                        In total, 19% of protests in Russia faced interventionin, in sharp contrast to Ukraine, where state responses 
                        occurred in 4% of protests. Excessive force is used in 1% of protests in Ukraine, whereas its value in Russia is less 
                        than 1%.
                        <br>
                        However, the peaceful protests are the predominant category in both nations, comprising 81% of the total protests in Russia 
                        and 96% in Ukraine.

                    <p>
                        After comparing the two countries, the final phase of the analysis focuses exclusively on the internal 
                        evolution of events in Ukraine.
                        The barchart illustrates the temporal trend of the total number of events that occurred in the country,
                        which shows a substantial increase starting in 2022, almost tripling the total number of events from the 
                        previous year and consequently highlighting the occurrence of a crucial phenomenon.

                        Subsequently, we seek to understand in greater depth and detail the increase in events that have occurred in 
                        the country over the years.
                        The visualization reveals a dramatic shift. Prior to 2022, "Protests" accounted for the majority of events. 
                        Since that year, however, their incidence has droped, coinciding with a significant increase in battles, 
                        explosions, and remote violence that now overshadows previous protests.
                        The 2022 peak in the "Violence against civilians" category is also significant, highlighting the armed conflict's 
                        heavy impact on the civilian population.

                        Taken all these insights together, they mark the beginning of the large-scale armed conflict. 
                        The data illustrates a clear transition point in 2022, moving from a state of political instability, primarily defined by protests, 
                        to an armed conflict, dominated by battles and remote violence.
