                            First, for a more general analysis, the focus is on the geographical distribution of 
                            civil unrest in Europe and Central Asia.

                            The following heatmap highlights the 15 countries with the highest number of 
                            total events recorded during the period analyzed (2017-2025).
                            In that period, is possible to observe that Russia and Ukraine have a particularly
                            high concentration of activities, with an increase starting in 2022.

                            Specifically, the first graph compares the number of different events 
                            (battles, protests, explosions/remote violence, riots and violence against civilians) 
                            that occurred in the two countries during the period analysed.
                            As expected, the significant number of battles and explosions that occurred in Ukraine stands out,
                             as does the high number of protests that occurred in Russia.
                            With regard to protests, the next graph analyses the proportional composition of the subtypes
                             of protests (peaceful, with intervention, with excessive force against protesters).
                            This allows us to visually compare the incidence of peaceful protests with those that required
                             intervention by the police (moderate or with excessive force), highlighting the different dynamics
                              of public order management in the two countries.

                        Moreover, an analysis was conducted to understand the distribution of protest types in Russia and Ukraine. 
                        The accompanying waffle chart illustrates the incidence of the three categories 
                        studied: "Peaceful protest," "Protest with intervention," and "Excessive force.

                            As shown in the chart, peaceful protests are the predominant category in both nations, 
                            comprising 81% of the total protests in Russia and 96% in Ukraine.

                            Conversely, protests involving a state response (classified as either "Protest with intervention" or "Excessive force") 
                            are recorded at a significantly higher rate in Russia. 
                            In total, 19% of protests in Russia faced intervention. 
                            This is in sharp contrast to Ukraine, where state responses occurred in 4% of protests (comprising 3% "Protest with intervention" and 1% "Excessive force").

                            Regarding the use of excessive force, this category is observed in 1% of all Ukrainian protests, 
                            whereas its value in the Russian is about 0%.

                        After comparing the two countries, the final phase of the analysis focuses exclusively on the internal evolution of events in Ukraine.
                        The bar chart illustrates the temporal trend of the total number of events that occurred in the country. 
                        Through this, it is possible to observe a net and substantial increase starting in 2022, almost tripling the total number of events that 
                        occurred in the previous year and consequently highlighting the occurrence of a crucial phenomenon.

                        Subsequently, we seek to understand in greater depth and detail the increase in events that have occurred in the country over the years.
                        The analysis highlights a real structural transformation.
                        Specifically, it should be noted that since 2022 there has been an increase in battles and a significant increase in explosions and remote violence, with the latter overshadowing the notable protests of previous years: while in the years prior to 2022 “Protests” accounted for the majority of events, since 2022 their incidence has plummeted.
                        In fact, protests are being replaced by “Battles” and, predominantly, by “Explosions/Remote violence”.
                        It is also significant to note the peak in the category “Violence against civilians” in 2022. 
                        Taken all these insights together, they mark the beginning of large-scale armed conflict.
