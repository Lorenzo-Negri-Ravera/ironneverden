                    <h3>Overview</h3>

                    <p>
                        This project is concerned with the analysis of data related to political violence and demonstration events, with a specific geographic focus on Europe and Central Asia.
                        The reference dataset is provided by the Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED), 
                        a global initiative that collects, curates, and publishes detailed information about political violence, armed conflict, and protest events around the world. 
                    </p>
                
                
                    <h3>Dataset</h3>
                    <p>
                        The dataset provides an aggregated view. Events are consolidated by temporal period and geographical position, 
                        consequently this structure enables the analysis and comparison of spatio-temporal patterns. 
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Specifically, the dataset provides a multidimensional structure for analysis. 
                        Geographically, each record is situated within a macro-area (<strong>REGION</strong>) and a specific <strong>COUNTRY</strong>, with events further localized to the primary administrative division (<strong>ADMIN1</strong>).
                        The temporal axis is defined by the <strong>WEEK</strong> field, which indicates the start week for data aggregation.
                    </p>
                    
                    <p>
                        Incident classification is provided at three levels of granularity: 
                        <strong>EVENT_TYPE</strong> (the main category, such as "Protests" or "Battles"), 
                        <strong>SUB_EVENT_TYPE</strong> (the specific classification, like "Peaceful protest"), 
                        and <strong>DISORDER_TYPE</strong> (a broader classification, such as "Political violence"). 
                        The primary quantitative metrics are <strong>EVENTS</strong>, representing the total count of incidents for that grouping, and <strong>FATALITIES</strong>, the sum of associated victims.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Finally, the dataset includes utility fields for spatial analysis and data linkage: 
                        <strong>CENTROID_LATITUDE</strong> and <strong>CENTROID_LONGITUDE</strong> provide the geographic centroid coordinates for the ADMIN1 area, 
                        <strong>POPULATION_EXPOSURE</strong> estimates the exposed population, and <strong>ID</strong> serves as a unique numeric identifier for the area.
